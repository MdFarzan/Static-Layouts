					<description><![CDATA[<p>This is a manifesto to change a country where a Master of Business Administration (MBA) is primarily to get a job, and not to start a business!</p>
<p>Serial entrepreneur Ajay Gupta is the quintessential Indian businessman. He has spent more than three decades in businesses creating companies that have grown despite numerous obstacles and challenges that came from within the entrepreneurial ecosystem, but more so from a societal mindset that has origins in the British Raj.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everything I thought to be true about life, its meaning was challenged after meeting Swami. It was reduced to dust. Soon I had to admit that there were things far beyond the scope of my rational mind.&#8217; What is it that draws one to a mystic? What is it like to know at close quarters a man whose powers are beyond the conscious mind? What does it feel like to be fulfilled spiritually, to feel understood, to stand revealed? As Ismita Tandon and Swami Vidyananda Om explore their feelings for Om Swami, their baffling experiences with him, a secret world of mystical phenomena lights up. They talk about the intimacy of their daily lives with Swami, observing his sheer power, his simplicity, his empathy for every living creature he encounters and the care with which he chooses every word he speaks, no matter how big or small the matter. They speak of his beauty, his divinity. What emerges is a moving portrait of devotion and trust, and the startling image of a saint who was able to inspire such depth of feeling.</p>
